  <p>
    <strong>BulkCTC</strong> is an informational platform dedicated to explaining
    <strong> CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) tea</strong> and how it behaves when used at
    scale. We focus on clarity around grades, strength, colour, and consistency —
    areas that are often misunderstood in bulk chai usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Chai is consumed every day across offices, cafés, canteens, factories, and
    retail outlets. Yet, most information available online is either consumer-
    focused or overly simplified. BulkCTC exists to bridge that gap by offering
    practical, business-relevant explanations around CTC tea.
  </p>

  <h2>What BulkCTC Covers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Different CTC tea grades and particle sizes</li>
    <li>Why some CTC teas brew darker or stronger than others</li>
    <li>The role of dust, fannings, and leaf size in chai</li>
    <li>How CTC tea behaves differently in bulk preparation</li>
    <li>Common misconceptions around “strong” chai</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Informational, Not Instructional</h2>

  <p>
    BulkCTC does not publish operational details such as pricing structures,
    internal sourcing methods, or proprietary supply processes. Instead, we focus
    on educational insights and industry-level observations that remain useful
    without being misleading.
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Platform Is For</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Café owners and food service operators</li>
    <li>Office pantry and facility managers</li>
    <li>Wholesale buyers and distributors</li>
    <li>Traders working with CTC tea</li>
    <li>Businesses sourcing chai in bulk quantities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Part of the GrayCup Ecosystem</h2>

    BulkCTC is owned and operated by <strong>GrayCup</strong>, a group of
    informational platforms focused on tea knowledge, sourcing, and quality.

    </li>
  </ul>

    and a commitment to clear, accurate information.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Understanding CTC grades matters more than brand names</li>
    <li>Consistency is often more important than intensity</li>
    <li>Better information leads to better sourcing decisions</li>
  </ul>
