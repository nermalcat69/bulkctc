## About BulkCTC

BulkCTC is an informational platform dedicated to **CTC tea and bulk chai knowledge**.  
We focus on explaining how CTC tea is graded, why different teas behave differently in brewing, and how businesses typically approach bulk chai sourcing.

Chai is consumed at scale every single day — in offices, cafés, canteens, factories, and retail outlets. Yet, there is very little clear information available about **CTC grades, strength variation, colour output, and consistency**. BulkCTC exists to fill that gap.

## What We Focus On

BulkCTC is not a consumer-facing tea brand.  
Our content is designed for **business owners, traders, distributors, and bulk buyers** who want to understand chai before making sourcing decisions.

We regularly cover topics such as:

- Different **CTC tea grades** and how they impact strength and colour  
- Why some CTC teas appear darker or stronger than others  
- The role of **dust, fannings, and leaf size** in chai preparation  
- How bulk chai behaves differently at scale compared to home brewing  
- Common misconceptions around “strong” vs “good” chai  

Our goal is clarity — not complexity.

## Informational, Not Instructional

BulkCTC does **not** publish content about internal supply chains, pricing structures, or operational sourcing processes.

Instead, we focus on:
- Educational explanations  
- Industry-level observations  
- Practical insights based on real-world usage  

This keeps the platform useful without revealing sensitive or misleading information.

## Relationship With GrayCup

BulkCTC is part of the **GrayCup ecosystem**, a group of platforms focused on tea knowledge, sourcing, and quality.

While GrayCup operates across multiple aspects of tea — including CTC, loose leaf, and bulk formats — BulkCTC remains **specifically focused on CTC tea education**.

Other informational platforms within the ecosystem explore:
- Bulk chai usage and buyer education
- Loose leaf and orthodox tea purity
- General tea processing and quality fundamentals

Each platform serves a distinct purpose, while maintaining consistent standards of accuracy and transparency.

BulkCTC is useful for:
- Café owners and food service operators  
- Office pantry and facility managers  
- Wholesale buyers and distributors  
- Traders exploring CTC grade differences  
- Businesses sourcing chai in bulk quantities  

If chai is consumed at scale in your operation, BulkCTC is designed to help you understand it better.

## Our Philosophy

We believe:
- Better information leads to better sourcing decisions  
- Not all “strong” chai is the same  
- Understanding CTC grades matters more than brand names  
- Consistency is often more valuable than intensity  

BulkCTC is built around these ideas — simple, practical, and grounded in real usage.
