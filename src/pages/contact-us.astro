	<h3>About BulkCTC</h3>

	<p>
		BulkCTC is an informational platform dedicated to <strong>CTC tea and bulk chai knowledge</strong>.
		We focus on explaining how CTC tea is graded, why different teas behave differently in brewing, 
		and how businesses typically approach bulk chai sourcing.
	</p>

	<p>
		Chai is consumed at scale every single day — in offices, cafés, canteens, factories, and retail 
		outlets. Yet, there is very little clear information available about <strong>CTC grades, strength 
		variation, colour output, and consistency</strong>. BulkCTC exists to fill that gap.
	</p>

	<h3>What We Focus On</h3>

	<p>
		BulkCTC is not a consumer-facing tea brand.<br />
		Our content is designed for <strong>business owners, traders, distributors, and bulk buyers</strong> 
		who want to understand chai before making sourcing decisions.
	</p>

	<p>We regularly cover topics such as:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Different <strong>CTC tea grades</strong> and how they impact strength and colour</li>
		<li>Why some CTC teas appear darker or stronger than others</li>
		<li>The role of <strong>dust, fannings, and leaf size</strong> in chai preparation</li>
		<li>How bulk chai behaves differently at scale compared to home brewing</li>
		<li>Common misconceptions around "strong" vs "good" chai</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Our goal is clarity — not complexity.</p>

	<h3>Informational, Not Instructional</h3>

	<p>
		BulkCTC does <strong>not</strong> publish content about internal supply chains, pricing structures, 
		or operational sourcing processes.
	</p>

	<p>Instead, we focus on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Educational explanations</li>
		<li>Industry-level observations</li>
		<li>Practical insights based on real-world usage</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This keeps the platform useful without revealing sensitive or misleading information.</p>

	<h3>Relationship With GrayCup</h3>

	<p>
		BulkCTC is part of the <strong>GrayCup ecosystem</strong>, a group of platforms focused on tea 
		knowledge, sourcing, and quality.
	</p>

	<p>
		While GrayCup operates across multiple aspects of tea — including CTC, loose leaf, and bulk 
		formats — BulkCTC remains <strong>specifically focused on CTC tea education</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>Other informational platforms within the ecosystem explore:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bulk chai usage and buyer education</li>
		<li>Loose leaf and orthodox tea purity</li>
		<li>General tea processing and quality fundamentals</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Each platform serves a distinct purpose, while maintaining consistent standards of accuracy and transparency.</p>

	<h3>Who This Platform Is For</h3>

	<p>BulkCTC is useful for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Café owners and food service operators</li>
		<li>Office pantry and facility managers</li>
		<li>Wholesale buyers and distributors</li>
		<li>Traders exploring CTC grade differences</li>
		<li>Businesses sourcing chai in bulk quantities</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If chai is consumed at scale in your operation, BulkCTC is designed to help you understand it better.</p>

	<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

	<p>We believe:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Better information leads to better sourcing decisions</li>
		<li>Not all "strong" chai is the same</li>
		<li>Understanding CTC grades matters more than brand names</li>
		<li>Consistency is often more valuable than intensity</li>
	</ul>

	<p>BulkCTC is built around these ideas — simple, practical, and grounded in real usage.</p>
