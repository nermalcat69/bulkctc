          Climate change is reshaping the future of coffee. Rising temperatures,
          unpredictable rainfall, droughts, pest outbreaks, and sea-level changes
          are putting one of the world's most loved beverages at risk. Today,
          nearly <span className="font-semibold">60% of all coffee species</span>{" "}
          are threatened with extinction — one of the highest risk levels recorded
          for any plant group.
